# Flappy_Bill
Final Project



Hello Everybody! 

I hope you enjoy my game; I worked very hard on it. 
Ive included several things to keep you entertained.. like music!!!!

This game was inspired by a childhood game that got rudly delisted from the app store known as "Flappy Bird"
I thought that nbow that I am in a python course I might as well recreate my childhood. 

The function of the game are pretty straightforward.
1. click the mouse pad to work through the herndon monumnets
2. get as far as you can. 
3. dont kill bill on army week
